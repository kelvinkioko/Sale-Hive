## Business Description
SaleHive is an android application that provides a centralized platform for users to discover and share information about products with the best discounts and the retail stores where they are sold. SaleHive is designed to help both consumers and retailers save time and money by providing a convenient and user-friendly solution to find and promote discounts.

SaleHive allows users to search for products by category, brand, or store and filter search results based on factors such as discount percentage, location, and availability. Users can create posts with information about discounted products, including product name, brand, retail store, price, discount percentage, and any other relevant details. They can also upload photos of the product and share their experiences or reviews. The application features a social element, allowing users to follow each other, like and comment on posts, and share posts on other social media platforms.

Retailers can partner with SaleHive and promote their discounts and promotions to users, helping them to reach new customers and increase sales. To ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information posted on the platform, SaleHive implements a moderation system where posts are reviewed and approved by moderators before being published. Users can also report inaccurate or misleading posts to moderators.

The success of SaleHive depends on its ability to attract and retain a significant user base and foster a vibrant and engaged community. SaleHive aims to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and feature-rich to ensure a positive user experience. With regular data analysis of user behavior and engagement, SaleHive will continuously improve and optimize the platform to provide maximum value to its users and retail partners.

## About Save Hive
### Problem Statement:
There is a lack of a convenient and centralized platform for users to discover and share information about products with the best discounts and the retail stores where they are sold, resulting in missed opportunities for savings and frustration for consumers.

### Why it is a problem:
Consumers are often faced with the challenge of finding the best deals on products they want to purchase. In addition, retailers face the challenge of reaching customers with their latest discounts and promotions. Without a centralized platform to share and discover information about products with the best discounts and where they are sold, both consumers and retailers miss out on potential savings and sales.

### Why it's critical to solve the problem:
With the ever-increasing cost of living, consumers are always looking for ways to save money. Retailers, on the other hand, are looking for ways to increase sales and customer loyalty. By providing a convenient and centralized platform for users to discover and share information about discounted products and where they are sold, the solution can help both consumers and retailers save time and money, ultimately increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

### How to measure the success of the solution:
The success of the solution can be measured by various metrics, such as the number of users who download and use the app, the number of posts created by users, the number of retailers that partner with the platform to promote their discounts, and the overall savings achieved by users. Additionally, user feedback and ratings can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and usefulness of the platform.
